                <p>Observers of world affairs like to point to a defining moment or pivotal event to proclaim the end of one era and the beginning of another. Not surprisingly, the novel coronavirus pandemic has already spawned much speculation that the world will undergo profound change as a consequence, even that contemporary history will forever be divided between what happened before coronavirus and after coronavirus. However, historical eras—and certainly international orders—rarely, if ever, hinge on singular events. They are simply too entrenched to change rapidly. For this reason, it is more accurate to identify transitional periods that span the rise and fall of specific international orders. In these periods, elements of the old order are still discernible, albeit functioning below their peak, while features of the new order are clearly emerging and playing a more influential role.

Just such a situation appears to exist today. The international order largely constructed by the United States in the aftermath of World War II is still very much in evidence, but, at the same time, the global distribution of power is inexorably shifting with the rise of new powers as well as influential nonstate actors. The United States is also growing more reluctant to bear the costs of world leadership, especially when it comes to using military force. China and Russia, along with lesser regional powers, have taken advantage of this reticence in recent years to assert their own interests and to undermine the United States’ international standing and authority.

      In addition, the benefits of the U.S-led order and, in particular, the many international agreements that the United States has championed to open up the world to the free flow of goods, services, ideas, and people, no longer look so promising—not least to many Americans. This shift has caused a public backlash against globalization not only in the United States but also in many Western countries.

                <p>India vs Australia World Cup 2023 Highlights: India started their World Cup campaign off with a resounding victory against Australia at the Chepauk on Sunday. After the bowlers had successfully restricted Australia to 199 in the first innings, Virat Kohli (85) and KL Rahul (97*) helped the hosts reach the target in 41.2 overs.

                 Kohli and Rahul weaved a 150+ runs partnership and dragged India out of the quagmire after they were in a world of trouble when they lost 3 wickets for just 2 runs on the board with skipper Rohit Sharma, Ishan Kishan and Shreyas Iyer all back in the hut.
